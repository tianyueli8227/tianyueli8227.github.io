Hi! I am a first-year master student in University of California San Diego (UCSD) at ECE department. I am interested in the intersection of Foundation model and Robotics. I took my undergraduate study at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor from 2021 to 2023 during which I was honored to be advised by by Professor [Jiaqi Ma](https://jiaqima.github.io/).


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
